h1. Add Varnish Monitoring to Server Density

Installation

* Configure your agent so that it knows about a plugin directory http://www.serverdensity.com/docs/agent/plugins/ 
* Move the Varnish.py into that directory 
* Your Varnish instance will need to be running with a Management Port (http://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ManagementPort)
* Edit plugin lines 15 and 16 to add your admin IP and Port. 
* Restart the agent (service sd-agent restart)

* Head to https://youraccount.serverdensity.com/plugins/ and Add new plugin
* Add a plugin called Varnish
* Edit the Varnish plugin and enter the groups for the graphs below, sorry you have to do this, but there's no way to suggest this layout in the plugin.
